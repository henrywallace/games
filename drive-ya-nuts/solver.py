'''Solve Drive-Ya-Nuts, and variations.

There are 7 nuts that each have 6 rotations. So there are 6^7 ~= 1e5 candidate
solutions, since the nuts are unique.

We will find solutions by checking validity of placing nuts along the following
ordered path. That is, we will DFS enumerate permutations of nuts along this
path, and discard a canidate path whenever an impossibility is reached.

  / 7  \___/ 3  \
  \    /   \    /
   `--<  2  >--`
       \___/

We call the ordered sequence of a nut's side values its order. The first value
of an order is defined in code below, per nut; but this module's functions
don't assume anything about those definitions. However, it is assumed that this
first nut, in hexagon 1, is placed such that its first value is facing toward
hexagon 2.

We also consider solutions in the space of all possible 7 nuts with unique
permuted values. For a nut with 6 unique values, one for each side, there are
6!  permutations... But 6 rotations create equivalence classes of size 6, so
the size of class representatives is 6!/6 = 5!. Now, there does exist a fast
method [1] for generating these equivalence classes, but with only 6 sides it
will be easy enough to dedup with `deque.rotate`.

If we also assume that we use 7 unique nuts, then there are 5! choose 7 ~= 1e10
possible Drive-Ya-Nuts boards. Whats the distribution of number of solutions
over all these boards?
