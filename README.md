# Games

This repo takes a looks at simple games, and their curious complexities. For
example:

- **Boggle**: What are the best words to memorize? What's the most benefial
  distribution of vowels on a board? What's the distribution of solutions over
  all boards?

- **Drive-Ya-Nuts**: How many solutions are there? What's the distribution of
  solutions over all possible nuts? How do we generalize to other tiling? In
  other dimensions?

- **Mastermind**: How is this game similar to Bethsada's Fallout terminals
  similar? Are there guarantees on how fast it can be solved?

- **Tenzi**: How long does the average game last?

- **Peggle**: How confident can you be that you're better than your opponent?
