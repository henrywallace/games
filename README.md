# Games

This repo contains some curiously interesting analyses of simple games. For example:

  - **Boggle**: *What are the best words to memorize? What's the most benefial
    distribution of vowels on a board? What's the distribution of solutions
    over all boards?*
  - **Drive-Ya-Nuts**: *How many solutions are there? What's the distribution
    of solutions over all possible nuts? How do we generalize to other tiling?
    In other dimensions?*
