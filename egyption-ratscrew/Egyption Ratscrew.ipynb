    "# Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Egyptian Ratscrew is a _very_ fun game. It basically goes like this: deal a deck of cards among your friends, face down. Then, taking turns, each person pops a card from their stack and places it face up into an intially empty pile. If someone places a royal onto the pile, then the next player is _CHALLENGED_. They must pop 1 card for a Jack, 2 for a Queen, 3 for a King, and 4 for an Ace; after which, the challenger gets to put the pile upside-down under their stack. The goal, is to be the last person with a non-empty stack. However, if someone who is challened pops a royal, then they cease popping cards and become the new challenger! Now, the most interesting quirk is that a player can slap the pile whenever the same face appears twice in a row, or appears as the bread in a 3 card sandwich. And anyone can slap in anytime, even if they have no cards left!"

    "# Some Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose each player has a response time following some distribution. Here are some questions we wish to be able to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. How likely is it that one can de-challenge a royal, where there are no slaps?\n",
    "  1. How does making those distributions different effect the distribution on the  number of turns?\n",
    "  1. Does the distribution of turns look the same no matter what distributions you choose for the player response times?\n",
    "  1. How strong is the correlation between \"fast\" response distribution and chance of winning?\n",
    "  1. If the number of turns follows a power distribution, what statistics are useful for describing how long a game will take?\n",
    "  1. What's a useful \"norm\" on those distributions?"
