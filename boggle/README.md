# Common Words in Boggle
I find the most common words in Boggle through a statistical argument. I also create a method to sorting the top words by their commonality using tfidf so that people have a list of words that are most likely to get you to score. **A notebook of the results can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/henrywallace/boggle/blob/master/boggle.ipynb)**.
